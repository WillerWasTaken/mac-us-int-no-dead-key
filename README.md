# OSX keyboard layout for US International AltGr no dead key

## Introduction

The layout was created using ukelele tool.
It is based off US keyboard layout but the Alt button was slightly changed to
fit no dead key layout, for the most part at least.

## Installation

Copy the keylayout file onto `/Libary/Keyboard\ Layout` folder and reboot your
mac.
```
sudo cp Us\ intl\ altgr\ no\ dead\ key.bundle/Contents/Resources/Us\ no\ dead\ key.keylayout /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
```
